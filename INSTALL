PLATFORMS
=========

PyCellChemistry has been tested on python 2.6 and 2.7, on MacOS and
Linux. The software is designed to be as platform independent as
possible, so we expect that it should run on other platforms as well,
although we had no opportunity for extensive testing so far.

REQUIREMENTS
============

The core of PyCellChemistry depends only on numpy (http://www.numpy.org).

Reaction-diffusion demos in the src/RD folder:

  If you'd like to animate them on the screen, VPython must be installed
  (http://vpython.org/).

  Alternatively animation can be disabled and PNG files generated instead
  (see the RD/GrayScott.py demo and the online documentation at
  www.artificial-chemistries.org for details)

Extra scripts in the src/scripts folder:

  For convenience, some extra shell scripts are provided in the
  examples/scripts folder. These scripts run the various artificial
  chemistry examples and plot the results.

  Many of these scripts rely on gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info) for
  plotting, some on python matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org).

  Although convenient, these scripts are not essential to run the
  various examples in python. Most of the examples generate
  tab-separated output that can be plotted with your favorite plotting
  tool (R, Matlab, Excel, ...)

INSTALLATION
============

1) Download the file pycellchem-2.0.tar.gz or pycellchem-2.0.zip and
   unpack it at your favorite location.

2) Move to the pycellchem-2.0/src folder and execute the desired
   example from the command line, such as:

   python Chameleons.py > chameleons.gr

   python MatrixChem.py > matchem.gr

3) Move to the pycellchem-2.0/src/RD folder to run the
   reaction-diffusion demos:

   python GrayScott.py

   python ActivatorInhibitor.py

see the documentation for more examples and detailed information about
each example.
